Hello, the wind is just right
I feel so good yoo-hoo
It was amazing because I was nervous
I just talked about the wrong things like a fool
I'm a little bit high. an upset heart
Do I look pretty to soothe you? He
I feel good Oh yeah, it's so sweet
I love it. I don't know
It's fun even if it's this much
Can't you just overlook one mistake
Should I sing a song
I could have done better. It's a beautiful day
It's a bit chilly the cold wind
You're using your heart in pain
I'm not worried It's time to get used to it
It's not just once or twice
Can I cry by myself sometimes
I want to cry and shake it off Oh, my
I'm fine now. I'll have one more drink
I look forward to your kind cooperation.
It's fun even if it's this much
Can't you just overlook one mistake
Should I sing a song
I could have done better. It's a beautiful day
It's fun even if it's this much
Can't you just overlook one mistake
Should I sing a song
I could have done better. It's a beautiful day
Goodbye.
So far, listen to me
Thank you so much
I look forward to your kind cooperation.
